# ABC Company Employee Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee data from ABC Company (458 employees, 9 attributes) to extract meaningful insights about team distribution, salary patterns, age demographics, and correlations.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Corrected height column with random values (150-180 cm)
2. **Analysis Tasks**:
   - Employee distribution across teams
   - Segregation by position
   - Predominant age group identification
   - Highest salary expenditure by team & position
   - Age-salary correlation analysis
3. **Visualizations**: 6 comprehensive charts
4. **Insights**: Data storytelling with key findings

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone repository: `git clone [(https://github.com/roshsony2690-ai/ABC-Employee-Data-Analysis-.git)]`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook ABC_Company_Analysis.ipynb`

## Key Findings
- Workforce distribution is uneven across teams, with certain teams having a higher employee count
- The **30–40 age group** is the predominant age group, indicating a relatively young workforce
- Senior positions contribute the most to salary expenditure
- Specific teams have significantly higher salary costs
- A **moderate positive correlation** exists between age and salary, suggesting experience influences compensation
